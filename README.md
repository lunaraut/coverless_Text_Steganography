This project implements coverless text steganography to securely hide sensitive information in text files before storing them in the cloud. It leverages AI-based techniques for encryption and tokenization to ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.

Key features include:
Key features include:

Secure text embedding: Hides information without relying on image covers.

AI-powered tokenization: Breaks down text into secure tokens for encryption.

Cloud-ready: Ensures your sensitive data can be safely uploaded to cloud storage.

Progress tracking: Monitors encryption and hiding processes with dynamic progress indicators.
